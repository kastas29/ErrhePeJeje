 * INSTRUCTIONS TO CREATE NEW COSMETICS
 * 
 * Requirements:
 *  - Image editing software that allows pixel art (Piskel, aseprite, etc...)
 *  
 *  1. Grab the image named "CharacterBorder.png"
 *  2. Drop it in your preferred software in a single layer. It is handy to get like the player template at the background
 *  3. Create another layer and draw whatever you want on top of the first layer with the character border
 *  4. (Some softwares requires to delete the first layer with the border) Export the layer with your drawing. Name the file like "Pants_Whatever". The options are "Body_", "Eyes_", "Face_", "Head_", "Pants_".
 *  5. Put the new file in the respective folder. "Your\Path\To\Game\mods\Cosmetics"
 *  6. There you go! You should be able to see the new cosmetics in the Character Creation Scene
 * 
 *  TIPS:
 *   - I would highly recommend you to create the canvas of 32x32 when you drop the character border in your desired software. This will allow you to create images a little bit wider or taller. Otherwise you would not be able to really see nothing more than the border of the player.
